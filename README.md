# copious-notes-extension
I didn't find this anywhere else, so I made it. A Chrome extension for adding private notes to a GitHub repository, similar to Jupyter GRAFFITI.

## Notes

- Use TypeScript.

# Functionality

- Highlight text, have a popup where can write notes, hover over to see previously written notes, summarize links at a bar at the bottom.
- Download data to export for others to view (no real-time collaboration feature).
- Have a popup of all notes on the page, and if on the chrome homepage, of all pages with notes on them.
- Can use service worker to save state, but is unnecessary for this extension.
